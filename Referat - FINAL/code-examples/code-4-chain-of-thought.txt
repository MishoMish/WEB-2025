Problem: Design a database schema for a blog system.

Think step-by-step:
1. What entities do we need? (users, posts, comments, etc.)
2. What relationships exist between entities?
3. What are the key attributes for each entity?
4. What indexes would optimize queries?
5. Are there any normalization considerations?

Provide your reasoning for each step, then the final schema.
